This is the core code of NNSplitter. It does not include the pre-trained models, but one can get the model with pre-trained weights available on Github.

1. Requirments:
   1) Python 3.6
   2) torch 1.10


2. Code:
   1) controller_rnn.py: a rnn controller that uses the REINFORCE algorithm to generate desired parameters. 
   2) utilis.py: includes some helper functions.
   3) train.py: used to train the victim model to lower accuracy. 
   4) main_cifar.py: optimize the victim model with the parameters generated by the controller.
